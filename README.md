# SudokuSolver
A java console programme that is derived from my repository called SudokuGame. This programme will allow you to type in a string representing a valid board of Sudoku, and the programme will determine whether the Sudoku is solvable or not. If it is solvable, the programme will display the solved Sudoku to the user.
