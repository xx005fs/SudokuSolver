# SudokuSolver
A java console programme that is derived from my repository called SudokuGame. This programme will allow you to type in a string representing a valid board of Sudoku, and the programme will determine whether the Sudoku is solvable or not. If it is solvable, the programme will display the solved Sudoku to the user.
# Introduction
### ALL THE FEATURES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED LATER...
This programme starts off to let the user to type in a string of a Sudoku board. A valid string of a Sudoku board is that there is no repeat of numbers in a row, column, and cell. The programme will check that automatically and if the user input doesn't satisfy the requirements, the programme will exit before it even starts trying to solve the Sudoku.

Also, the programme was added a new bruteForce() method, which is a brute force solver for the Sudoku board that is not using recursion. It is a back tracking method but instead of using recursion I decided to use while loop instead. There is a variable in the method that stores the previous value of a certain block, and then whenever it realize that at some block that all numbers from 1 to 9 won't be able to fill in, it will back track to the previous blocks and try different numbers that are after the stored value on that block before. If the solver couldn't solve a Sudoku, this means that the Sudoku board can only be invalid to be unsolveable because the brute force method will check all possible combination of a certain board, and if the board has no matching combination, this means that there is a mistake in this certain board.

The user interface has completely changed from the game. Instead of having to choose difficulty and fill in a value to a Sudoku board, there is no need for that as the user is not going to be trying to fill in any value for the board and trying to solve it themselves, and instead the machine is going to do that for the user. The user will be prompted to type in the string for Sudoku board, which is comprised with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. Whenever there is an empty block in the Sudoku board that the user wants to solve, the user will replace that with a number 0, and it doesn't matter if the user types in the board like this (000000000) or (000 000 000), the machine would turn it into a valid board anyways. If the user typed string with all the spaces removed isn't 81 characters long that is comprised with all numbers, the machine would tell the user that this is an invalid input, and ask the user to try again. After the machine verifies that the board is valid, it will display the Sudoku board to the user to let the user verify if the board is correct or not. If the user choose that it doesn't match their Sudoku that wants to be solves, and they select the option that says 'no', the programme would quit and if the user will try to solve again they would have to restart the programme. If they choose 'yes' and they confirmed that the board is correct, the machine would try to solve it using the logic method first, which analyses the board in the process of doing it, and that is what allows the brute force solver to be able to solve the Sudoku, and after all the solver is complete, the machine would display out the board that is solved so the user can see what it looks like.
